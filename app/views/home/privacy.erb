<h3>Website Visitors</h3> 
<p>Like most website operators, Aplanofattack collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Aplanofattack&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Aplanofattack&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Aplanofattack may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p> 

<p>Aplanofattack also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Aplanofattack does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
 
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3> 
<p>Certain visitors to Aplanofattack’s websites choose to interact with Aplanofattack in ways that require Aplanofattack to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Aplanofattack gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who who want to save their testimonials to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Aplanofattack - by paying for premium services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Aplanofattack collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Aplanofattack. Aplanofattack does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p> 

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3> 
<p>
Aplanofattack may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. 
For instance, Aplanofattack may monitor
user interaction of our admin panel in order to improve the user experience. 
We also may monitor user interactions on our Facebook application and/or widgets to improve usability. Aplanofattack may display this information, in aggregate, publicly or provide it to others. However, Aplanofattack does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p> 


<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3> 
<p>Aplanofattack discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Aplanofattack's behalf or to provide services available at Aplanofattack's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Aplanofattack's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Aplanofattack will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Aplanofattack discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Aplanofattack believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Aplanofattack, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Aplanofattack account and have supplied your email address, Aplanofattack may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Aplanofattack and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Aplanofattack takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p> 

<h3>Facebook Page Assets and Aplanofattack Account Data</h3> 
<p>
In order to serve your pages via our application and allow continous management and organization of page data and any associated assets, we have to store data in our database.
To ensure your data is protected and backed up, we may save this data in multiple locations using cloud services such as Amazon Web Services.
Facebook also routinely caches many elements of and including the entire rendered page in order to improve speed.
Data may be shared with 3rd party vendors such as Amazon <b>only</b> insofar as we deem necessary to provide adequate security and backup protocols. 
Your data will never be made publicly available in any manner whatsoever other than that which you specifically allow such as embedding any of our products, apis, or widgets into public facing properties,
and of course rendering pages in Facebook automatically assumes you are aware of and agree to Facebook's own privacy policy.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3> 
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Aplanofattack uses cookies to help Aplanofattack identify and track visitors, their usage of Aplanofattack website, and their website access preferences. Aplanofattack visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Aplanofattack's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Aplanofattack's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
